# XML-Stomper (Superceded)

There are often examples where data analysts need to 'flatten out' XML documents to a relational structure (say CSV file) in order to work with it in tools like R Studio or Python / Pandas. 

The XML-Stomper was a simple and somewhat limited script achieving that aim. Rather than use this tool, we recommend that you use the [xml-flattener](https://github.com/DevWorxCo/xml-flattener) project instead.
