# Data-Cornucopia

This repository is a collection of data developments tools, examples and other miscellany useful in a variety of projects and consultancy arrangements.

The maturity and generic applicability of these projects vary significantly. For instance, some may very specific for a particular use-case and I have have not yet had the opportunity to expand and make it production ready.

Hopefully this will improve over time as feedback as derivations of these examples / projects are applied to real world problems.  

## XML-Stomper

There are often examples where data analysts need to 'flatten out' XML documents to a relational structure (say CSV file) in order to work with it in tools like R Studio or Python / Pandas. 

The XML-Stomper example is the first step towards that goal.

_Still requires some work to make more generic_

## Etcetera

A number of small relatively inconsequential programs and examples that may be useful to serve as 'mental' notes when building out larger applications.

## JDBC-Runner

A very simple and very tactical tool that can be used to execute a number of JDBC statements against a number of databases.

Was used as part of a project to do some data discovery.
