Our business model focuses on achieving superior returns and profit growth with the careful management of risk. We pursue these goals through geographic and product diversification, as well as an in-depth understanding of our insured exposures. Our product mix includes, primarily, workers’ compensation, extended warranty and other commercial property/casualty insurance products. Our workers’ compensation and property/casualty insurance policyholders in the United States are generally small and middle market businesses. Our extended warranty customers are manufacturers, distributors and retailers of commercial and consumer products. We have also built a strong and growing distribution of extended warranty and specialty risk products, including liability and other property/casualty products, in Europe. The majority of our products are sold through independent third-party brokers, agents, retailers or administrators. Our strategy is to target small to middle size customer markets throughout the U.S. and Europe where our proprietary technology platform enables us to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that result from serving large numbers of small policyholders and warranty contract holders. The technology we have developed offers a level of service that is a competitive advantage in these high volume, lower risk markets by enhancing our ability to service, underwrite and adjudicate claims. Additionally, our ability to maintain and analyze high volumes of loss data over a long historical period allows us to better manage and forecast the underlying risk inherent in the portfolio. Since our inception in 1998, we have grown both organically and through an opportunistic acquisition strategy. We believe we approach acquisitions conservatively, and our strategy is to take relatively modest integration and balance sheet risk. Our acquisition activity has involved the purchase of companies, renewal rights to established books of insurance portfolios, access to distribution networks and the hiring of established teams of underwriters with expertise in our specialty lines.",,,,,USD,2015-09-17,2020-01-28,,,,,,,,,

The following is a reconciliation of GAAP earnings to non-GAAP earnings, excluding the one-time items for earnings before tax (pre-tax), net earnings attributable to Kirby (after-tax), and diluted earnings per share (per share): First Nine Months 2018 Pre-Tax After-Tax Per Share (unaudited, $ in millions except per share amounts) GAAP earnings $ 144.5 $ 102.9 $ 1.72 Executive Chairman retirement 18.1 18.1 0.30 Higman transaction fees & expenses 3.3 2.5 0.04 Amendment to employee stock plan 3.9 3.0 0.05 Earnings, excluding one-time items (2) $ 169.8 $ 126.5 $ 2.11 MARINE TRANSPORTATION PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS Third Quarter Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Inland Performance Measurements: Ton Miles (in millions) (3) 3,958 3,721 10,811 10,824 Revenue/Ton Mile (cents/tm) (4) 8.0 7.7 8.4 7.6 Towboats operated (average) (5) 304 282 299 275 Delay Days (6) 2,284 2,534 10,228 6,797 Average cost per gallon of fuel consumed $ 2.00 $ 2.23 $ 2.06 $ 2.13 Barges (active): Inland tank barges 1,065 981 Coastal tank barges 49 54 Offshore dry-cargo barges 4 5 Barrel capacities (in millions): Inland tank barges 23.7 21.6 Coastal tank barges 4.7 5.1 (1) Kirby has historically evaluated its operating performance using numerous measures, one of which is EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Kirby defines EBITDA as net earnings attributable to Kirby before interest expense, taxes on income, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, and impairment of goodwill. EBITDA is presented because of its wide acceptance as a financial indicator. EBITDA is one of the performance measures used in Kirby’s incentive bonus plan. EBITDA is also used by rating agencies in determining Kirby’s credit rating and by analysts publishing research reports on Kirby, as well as by investors and investment bankers generally in valuing companies. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to, but should only be considered in conjunction with, Kirby’s GAAP financial information. (2) Kirby uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to review performance excluding certain one-time items including: earnings before taxes on income, excluding one-time items; net earnings attributable to Kirby, excluding one-time items; and diluted earnings per share, excluding one-time items. Management believes that the exclusion of certain one-time items from these financial measures enables it and investors to assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing those results with previous and subsequent periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management views the excluded items to be outside of the company's normal operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not calculations based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to, but should only be considered in conjunction with, Kirby’s GAAP financial information. (3) Ton miles indicate fleet productivity by measuring the distance (in miles) a loaded tank barge is moved. Example: A typical 30,000 barrel tank barge loaded with 3,300 tons of liquid cargo is moved 100 miles, thus generating 330,000 ton miles. (4) Inland marine transportation revenues divided by ton miles. Example: Third quarter 2019 inland marine transportation revenues of $316,000,000 divided by 3,958,000,000 inland marine transportation ton miles = 8.0 cents. (5) Towboats operated are the average number of owned and chartered towboats operated during the period. (6) Delay days measures the lost time incurred by a tow (towboat and one or more tank barges) during transit. The measure includes transit delays caused by weather, lock congestion and other navigational factors. Contact: Eric Holcomb 713-435-1545",,,,,USD,1991-08-21,2020-01-28,,,,,,,,,

According to the 2019 Self-Storage Almanac, CubeSmart is one of the top three owners and operators of self-storage properties in the United States. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Funds from operations (“FFO”) is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the “White Paper”), as amended and restated, defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and related impairment charges, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a key performance indicator in evaluating the operations of the Company's stores. Given the nature of its business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company believes that FFO is useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring its operational performance because FFO excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of its operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures, impairments of depreciable assets, and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. The Company’s computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company’s performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of the Company’s ability to make cash distributions. The Company believes that to further understand its performance, FFO should be compared with its reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in its Consolidated Financial Statements. FFO, as adjusted represents FFO as defined above, excluding the effects of acquisition related costs, gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt, and other non-recurring items, which the Company believes are not indicative of the Company’s operating results. The Company defines net operating income, which it refers to as “NOI,” as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income (loss): interest expense on loans, loan procurement amortization expense, loan procurement amortization expense – early repayment of debt, acquisition related costs, equity in losses of real estate ventures, other expense, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income (loss): gains from sale of real estate, net, other income, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures and interest income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management uses NOI as a measure of operating performance at each of its stores, and for all of its stores in the aggregate. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes NOI is useful to investors in evaluating operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used by management and store managers to evaluate the economic productivity of the Company’s stores, including the ability to lease stores, increase pricing and occupancy, and control property operating expenses. Additionally, NOI helps the Company’s investors meaningfully compare the results of its operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense on outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of the basis in its assets from operating results.",,,,,USD,2004-10-22,2020-01-28,,,,,,,,,

JHG management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from revenue in the computation of net revenue reflects the nature of these expenses, as these costs are passed through to external parties that perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the Group’s managed AUM. 2 Adjustments primarily represent integration costs in relation to the Merger, including severance costs, legal costs and consulting fees. JHG management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 3 2019 adjustments primarily represent contingent consideration adjustments associated with acquisitions prior to the Merger and increased debt expense as a consequence of the fair value uplift on debt due to acquisition accounting. Adjustments for the three months ended 30 June 2018 primarily represent fair value movements on options issued to Dai-ichi in addition to contingent consideration costs associated with acquisitions prior to the merger. JHG management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 4 Investment management contracts have been identified as a separately identifiable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses. Such contracts are recognised at the net present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the contracts at the date of acquisition. For segregated mandate contracts, the intangible asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contracts. The three months ended 30 June 2019 also include a US$18 million impairment of certain mutual fund contracts. JHG management believes these non-cash and acquisition-related costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 5 The tax impact of the adjustments is calculated based on the US or foreign statutory tax rate as they relate to each adjustment. Certain adjustments are either not taxable or not tax-deductible.

(2) Time Charter Equivalent (\""TCE\"") rate, a non-GAAP measure, represents net revenues divided by revenue days. Revenue days are the total number of calendar days the vessels are in our possession less off-hire days generally associated with drydocking or repairs, idle days or repositioning associated with vessels held for sale. For vessels employed on voyage charters, TCE is the net rate after deducting voyage expenses incurred, divided by revenue days, including, among other expenses, all commissions and pool administration fees. TCE is reported on a discharge to discharge basis. (3) Fleet operating expenses per day are routine operating expenses and comprise crewing, repairs and maintenance, insurance, stores, lube oils and communication expenses. They do not include additional expenses related to the upgrading or enhancement of the vessels that are not capitalized. (4) Technical management fees are fees paid to third-party technical managers. (5) Vessel operating expenses per day include technical management fees.

(5) $387.16 DRV / Share (3)(5) $11.70 1. Based on broker estimates of prompt resale for a newbuild vessel of equivalent deadweight tonne at a yard in South Korea as at September 30, 2019. 2. Depreciated Replacement Value (\""DRV\"") is based on estimated resale price for a newbuild vessel depreciated for the age of each vessel (assuming an estimated useful life of 25 years on a straight-line basis and assuming a residual scrap value of $300 per tonne which is in line with Ardmore's depreciation policy). The Company's estimates of DRV assume that its vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without the need for repair and, if inspected, that they would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Vessel values are highly volatile and, as such, the Company's estimates of DRV may not be indicative of the current or future value of its vessels, or prices that the Company could achieve if it were to sell them. 3. DRV / Share calculated using 33,097,831 shares outstanding as at September 30, 2019. 4. Ardmore Commercial Management is management's estimate of the value of Ardmore's commercial management and pooling business. The estimate is based on industry standard commercial management and pooling fees in determining revenue less Ardmore's commercial and chartering overhead (as stated in Ardmore's Statement of Operations) and applying an illustrative multiple to the resulting net earnings of 7x. The multiple is illustrative only and may not be indicative of the valuation multiple the Company could achieve if it were to sell its commercial management and pooling business. Revenue of this business is comprised of (i) commission (1.25% for standard product tankers and 2.5% for chemical tankers) on gross freight based on estimated current TCE rates grossed up for fuel and voyage costs and (ii) administration fee of $300 per vessel per day. These rates may vary over time. 5. Depreciated Asset Value (\""DRV\"") and DRV per share are non-GAAP measures. Management believes that many investors use DRV as a reference point in assessing valuation of fleets of ships and similar assets. CO 2 Emissions Reporting In April 2018, the International Maritime Organization's (\""IMO\"") Marine Environment Protection Committee (\""MEPC\"") adopted an initial strategy for the reduction of greenhouse gas (\""GHG\"") emissions from ships, setting out a vision to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping and phase them out as soon as possible. Ardmore is committed to transparency and contributing to the reduction of CO 2 emissions in the Company's industry. Effective July 1, 2019, the Company has commenced reporting of carbon emissions data for its fleet. Ardmore's reporting methodology is in line with the framework set out within the IMO's Data Collection System (\""DCS\"") initiated in January 2019. Three months ended Nine months ended Mar 31, 2019 Jun 30, 2019 Sep 30, 2019 Sep 30, 2019 Number of vessels in operation at the end of the reporting period 26 25 25 25 Fleet average age at end of reporting period in years 6.0 5.9 6.2 6.2 CO 2 emissions generated from vessels in metric tonnes 96,819 112,346 115,169 324,334 Fleet Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) ([1]) for the period 6.59g / tonne-mile 6.08g / tonne-mile 5.48g / tonne-mile 6.05g / tonne-mile Fleet Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) ([2]) for the period 13.79g / tonne-mile 12.10g / tonne-mile 12.57g / tonne-mile 12.82g / tonne-mile It is expected that the shipping industry will continue to refine the performance measures for emissions and efficiency over time. AER and EEOI metrics are impacted by external factors such as charter speed, vessel orders and weather, in conjunction with overall market factors such as cargo load sizes and fleet utilization rate. As such, variance in performance can be found in the reported emissions between two periods for the same vessel and between vessels of a similar size and type. Furthermore, other companies may report slight variations in methodology (3 ) and consequently it is not always practical to directly compare emissions from different companies. The figures reported above represent Ardmore's initial findings; the Company is committed to improving the methodology and transparency of its emissions reporting in line with industry best practices. Accordingly, the above results may vary as the methodology and performance measures set out by the industry evolve. __________________________ 1 Annual Efﬁciency Ratio (\""AER\"") is a measure of carbon efficiency using the parameters of fuel consumption, distance travelled, and design deadweight tonnage (\""DWT\""). AER is reported in unit grams of CO 2 per ton-mile (gCO 2 /dwt-nm). It is calculated by dividing (i) mass of fuel consumed by type converted to metric tonnes of CO 2 by (ii) DWT multiplied by distance travelled in nautical miles 2 Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (\""EEOI\"") is a tool for measuring the CO 2 gas emissions in a given time period per unit transport work performed. It is calculated by dividing (i) mass of fuel consumed by type converted to metric tonnes of CO 2 by (ii) cargo carried in tonnes multiplied by laden voyage distance in nautical miles. This calculation is performed as per IMO MEPC.1/Circ684. Ardmore's EEOI data is measured based on the reporting tools and information reasonably available to the applicable third-party technical managers. Management assesses such data from the third-party technical managers and may adjust and restate the data to reflect an appropriate fleet-wide assessment methodology 3 Some shipping companies report CO 2 in tonne per kilometre as opposed to CO 2 in tonnes per nautical mile Non-GAAP Measures This press release describes EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and net loss from continuing operations, which are not measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are defined and reconciled below. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before certain items that Ardmore believes are not representative of its operating performance, including gain or loss on sale of vessels. Net loss from continuing operations excludes certain items from GAAP net loss because they are considered to be unusual items, including gain or loss on sale of vessels. These non-GAAP measures are presented in this press release as the Company believes that they provide investors with a means of evaluating and understanding how Ardmore's management evaluates operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA increase the comparability of the Company's fundamental performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of interest expense, taxes, depreciation or amortization, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income between periods. The Company believes that including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and net loss from continuing operations as financial and operating measures assists investors in making investment decisions regarding the Company and its common stock. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not have a standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. All amounts in the tables below are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated.

Furthermore, because forward‐looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements, and our future performance could differ materially from our historical results. Our forward‐looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: general economic conditions and trends, either nationally or locally; conditions in the securities markets; changes in interest rates; changes in deposit flows, and in the demand for deposit, loan, and investment products and other financial services; changes in real estate values; changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; changes in competitive pressures among financial institutions or from non‐financial institutions; our ability to obtain the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals of any acquisitions we may propose; our ability to successfully integrate any assets, liabilities, customers, systems, and management personnel we may acquire into our operations, and our ability to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames; changes in legislation, regulations, and policies; and a variety of other matters which, by their nature, are subject to significant uncertainties and/or are beyond our control. More information regarding some of these factors is provided in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10‐K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and in other SEC reports we file. Our forward‐looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those we may discuss in this news release, on our conference call, during investor presentations, or in our SEC filings, which are accessible on our website and at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. - Financial Statements and Highlights Follow - NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC.

RECONCILIATIONS OF CERTAIN GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (unaudited) While stockholders' equity, total assets, and book value per share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\""GAAP\""), tangible stockholders' equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per share are not. Nevertheless, it is management's belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in our earnings releases and other investor communications for the following reasons: Tangible stockholders' equity is an important indication of the Company's ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. Returns on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity are among the profitability measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company's peers. Tangible book value per share and the ratio of tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, its peers. Tangible stockholders' equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP profitability and capital measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets, or any other profitability or capital measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names. The following table presents reconciliations of our common stockholders' equity and tangible common stockholders' equity, our total assets and tangible assets, and the related GAAP and non-GAAP profitability and capital measures at or for the periods indicated: At or for the At or for the Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (dollars in thousands) 2019 2019 2018 2019 2018 Total Stockholders' Equity $    6,711,694 $    6,695,007 $    6,655,235 $    6,711,694 $    6,655,235 Less: Goodwill (2,426,379) (2,426,379) (2,436,131) (2,426,379) (2,436,131) Preferred stock (502,840) (502,840) (502,840) (502,840) (502,840) Tangible common stockholders' equity $    3,782,475 $    3,765,788 $    3,716,264 $    3,782,475 $    3,716,264 Total Assets $  53,640,821 $  52,537,629 $  51,899,376 $  53,640,821 $  51,899,376 Less: Goodwill (2,426,379) (2,426,379) (2,436,131) (2,426,379) (2,436,131) Tangible assets $  51,214,442 $  50,111,250 $  49,463,245 $  51,214,442 $  49,463,245 Average Common Stockholders' Equity $    6,187,536 $    6,201,970 $    6,244,977 $    6,161,146 $    6,280,081 Less: Average goodwill (2,426,379) (2,426,379) (2,436,131) (2,428,703) (2,436,131) Average tangible common stockholders' equity $    3,761,157 $    3,775,591 $    3,808,846 $    3,732,443 $    3,843,950 Average Assets $  52,477,691 $  52,257,718 $  51,779,002 $  52,109,095 $  50,213,340 Less: Average goodwill (2,426,379) (2,426,379) (2,436,131) (2,428,703) (2,436,131) Average tangible assets $  50,051,312 $  49,831,339 $  49,342,871 $  49,680,392 $  47,777,209 Net Income Available to Common Shareholders $         92,967 $         90,839 $         93,532 $       362,215 $       389,589 GAAP MEASURES: Return on average assets (1) 0.77 % 0.76 % 0.79 % 0.76 % 0.84 % Return on average common stockholders' equity (2) 6.01 5.86 5.99 5.88 6.20 Book value per common share $           13.29 $           13.25 $           12.99 $           13.29 $           12.99 Common stockholders' equity to total assets 11.57 11.79 11.85 11.57 11.85 NON-GAAP MEASURES: Return on average tangible assets (1) 0.81 % 0.80 % 0.82 % 0.80 % 0.88 % Return on average tangible common stockholders' equity (2) 9.89 9.62 9.82 9.70 10.14 Tangible book value per common share $             8.09 $             8.06 $             7.85 $             8.09 $             7.85 Tangible common stockholders' equity to tangible assets 7.39 7.51 7.51 7.39 7.51 (1) To calculate return on average assets for a period, we divide net income generated during that period by average assets recorded during that period.

Nevertheless, management uses this non-GAAP measure in its analysis of our performance, and believes that this non-GAAP measure should be disclosed in our earnings releases and other investor communications for the following reasons: Adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income and other items on our net interest margin. Prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay, or securities that prepay, during that period. Such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. Adjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, our peers. NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC.
